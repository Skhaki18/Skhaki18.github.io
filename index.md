## About Me

Engineers live their lives considering the ‘what-ifs’ of applied science, with the primary goal being to improve life. This mindset begins with asking: How do things work and can I make them better?

As a software engineer, I can appreciate the complexity and depth required to answer these questions. My passion stems from an innate drive to ‘look beyond what is’. 

My name is Samir Khaki.
