## About Me

I am a graduate student at the Univeristy of Toronto researching efficient machine learning applied to computer vision and natural language processing. Currently at Google building multi-modal machine learning models.

## Research Interests
- **Efficient Deep Learning:** efficient inferencing, knowledge/data distillation, model compression
- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, foundation models
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, continual learning, contrastive learning
